theater.

## Setup

Run this command to get the backend started:

```console
$ json-server --watch db.json
```
Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Then, open the `index.html` file on your browser to run the application.

Write your code in the `src/index.js` file. The base URL for your API will be
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
